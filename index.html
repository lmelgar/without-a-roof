          In Florida more than 71,000 students are homeless. During the last decade this population rocketed as
          a result of the recession and the hardship that poorest families face when they want to find affordable housing.

        <p>There are over a million students enrolled in U.S. public schools that share classrooms, teachers and playgrounds with tens of millions of other children. But when the bell rings and its time to call it a day, one thing differentiates them from the rest: they are homeless.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Florida is the fourth state with the largest number of homeless students</strong>. It stands behind California, New York and Texas, the most populous areas in the country. Over the last years, the Sunshine State has seen a dramatic increase in the number of homeless children enrolled in its public schools: from 2005 to the 2013-2014 academic year, the figure grew a staggering 142% and reached 71,446.
        </p>
        <p>It's an increase that mirrors a general trend in the United States. Florida's Council on Homelessness said in a report last year that one of the fastest growing segments of the homeless population in the country are families with children, something also seen in Florida.
        </p>
        <p>It's relatively easy to identify a homeless adult in the streets, whose numbers have dropped in Florida in the last years. But where are the homeless students?
        </p>
        <p>The definition of what constitutes a homeless student is different than for adults. <strong>The public education system says that a student falls into this category when he or she lacks "a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence."</strong> It's also those that share a home with other people "due to loss of housing" or "economic hardship."

        <p>The majority of homeless students are in Florida's central and southern counties, like Orange, Osceola, Polk, Miami-Dade and Hillsborough. These are also the most populous counties in the state.</p>

        <p>The story changes when measuring the number of homeless students in relation to the total student population. In such case, <strong>counties such as Franklin and Madison top the list: 20% of its students are homeless, well above the 2.6% state average</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>In the 2013-2014 academic year, 75% of homeless students lived in other people's homes, sharing the house with them. 11.7% lived in shelters and 10.7% in hotels and motels. A minority was on the streets, according to the Consolidated State Performance Report.
        </p>

        <p>Out of Florida's 71,000 homeless population, 10.6% lived without adult supervision. 17.8% had some kind of disability and 10% had difficulties to speak, read, write or understand English, which could have a negative impact in their school performance.
        </p>

        <p>In most counties with the highest percentage of homeless students, the presence of minorities is higher than the state's average.</p>

      <p>The U.S.' most recent economic crisis gives some context to the increase in homeless students.
      </p>

      <p>In September 2008, the financial firm Lehman Brothers broke. It was the peak of the Great Recession, which had officially started in December 2007. In Florida the sales of single-family homes had slumped for three years in a row, and 2009 would be no different, with a 7% decrease.
      </p>

      <p>The recession officially lasted just over a year and a half. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, it ended in June 2009. <strong>But while the economy began its slow recovery, unemployment in Florida was at a 10.7%</strong>. By the end of the year it increased to 11.2%, while the national rate stood at 9.9%. The state's unemployment rate stayed at the double digits for two more years.
      </p>

      <p>The majority of counties with the highest rate of homeless students have always been among the areas with the state's lowest household median income.

    <p>Although the average household income in Florida varied little during the Great Recession, some counties did suffer major jolts. <strong>They include Madison, Gadsden, Hamilton, Lafayette and Okeechobee, where the average household income fell, in some cases, more than 20%.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The poorest families, with the lowest incomes, took longer to recover and return to pre-crisis levels, said PolicyLab and First Focus in their report "The Effect of the Great Recession on Child Well-Being," published in 2015.

    <p>There is a decisive factor that seems to explain the phenomenon of homeless students. According to the Council on Homelessness, the “need of for available, adequate, and affordable housing” is the main cause homelessness.
    </p>

    <p>Many families lost their home due to the crisis. PolicyLab and First Focus estimate that "near the peak of the crisis", one out of 46 properties in the U.S. was foreclosed. In addition, <strong>during the recession, about 2.3 million children in single family houses lost their homes due to foreclosures</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Foreclosures were nothing new in Florida. In 2008, 10 counties in the state where among the areas with the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Only California was higher in the ranking with 12 counties, according to Pew research.
    <p>

    <p>But the recession surely hit the Sunshine State hard. At the end of 2012, Florida had “the biggest share of foreclosure inventory of any state,” according to RealtyTrac numbers cited in a report of the Office of Economic and Demographic Research.
    </p>

    <p>That same year, Brookings and First Focus estimated that six million kids in the U.S. were “at risk of losing their homes.” Also, 40.9 million U.S. households were using more than 30% of their income to pay for housing.
    </p>

    <p>In Florida, hundreds of thousands of families were also spending much of their income in housing. <strong>In 2007, 577,242 homes were spending more than 40% of their income in rent</strong>. These were households whose annual earnings were below 60% of Florida's median income. Six years later, that number climbed to 715,032 families, according to a study done by University of Florida's Shimberg Center for Housing Studies.</p>

    <p>Out of the total homes in Florida with low income -close to one million in 2013-, "nearly half (44 percent)" were considered to be "extremely low income."</p>

    <p><strong>For poor families who spend much of their resources to pay their housing, the problem is the lack of options</strong>. The affordable housing offer is very limited in Florida. For every 100 extremely poor households, " there are only 31 affordable and available units" says a University of Florida report.</p>

  <p>Some researchers say that public social programs were crucial to reduce the impact of the crisis on families and children. First Focus' study says that many states maintained or increased their food aid during the recession. Other kinds of aid helped a lot of families to keep their homes. Still, First Focus points that many of these programs are now suffering budget cuts.</p>

  <p>From 2005 to 2013, the number of children that received food aid in Florida grew 135% to 1,380,248. The year with the highest increase was 2009, with 33%.

    <p>Asthma and hyperactivity are the most common conditions among homeless children. They also "have three times the rate of emotional and behavioral problems, such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, withdrawal and aggression," says an inform of Child Trends.
    </p>

    <p>Being a homeless child also has an impact in their school performance: <strong>They are "more than twice as likely others to repeat a school grade, be expelled or suspended, or drop out of high school."</strong>
    </p>

    <p>To give an example: the Institute for Children, Poverty &amp; Homelessness discovered that during the 2013-2014 academic year, only 17% of New York's homeless students reached the minimum academic standards in math. And recovering their homes doesn't guarantee an improvement in results. Among the children who were once homeless, only 20% achieved an optimal level in mathematics.
